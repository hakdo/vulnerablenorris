# Demo project
This is a simple demo project showing how remote code execution bugs work in web applications. 
The code has two endpoints: 

- '/': No RCE
- '/dangerzone': RCE through command injection using query parameters

:) '/dangerzone' will give give you a Chuck Norris joke. 
:) '/dangerzone?category=fashion' will give you a Chuck Norris joke
:( '/dangerzone?category=fashion%26%26whoami' will give you nightmares

# Dependencies
## General
The jokes are generated by the excellent API service https://api.chucknorris.io/. 

## NodeJs dependencies
See package-lock.json.

## Shell dependencies
- curl: https://curl.se/
- jq: https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ 

The '/' endpoint is set up to post the joke to a webhook with the payload {text: joke}. 
The webhook URL must be configured as an environment variable in the shell environment: 

`export webhook=<url-goes-here>`

If you do not set up a webhook, the application logs this at warning level but returns the joke 
in the HTTP response.
